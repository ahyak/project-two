#Overview:

+ There are so many blogs and websites that share beauty, fitness, and health information with people but most of these websites have a lot of sponsored content and can sometimes be in-genuine as they are only looking after selling a specific product or promoting specific brand.  

+ I created a web application dedicated to all the females who have tips and tricks to share with others in regards to health, fitness and beauty. Also, for females who have real interest and don't just want to buy into posts they read online. This application provides a community for women to share with each other and learn from each other and excel on all things that will help them Inside and Out. Simply put, a blog where there is no limitations on what you'd like to ask, or share with others.
