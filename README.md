# Overview:

The 2-player game to find all the matching pairs of cards in the least amount of time.

Taking turns, two players attempt to match all pairs of cards shown in the
least amount of time. After each player has completed their round, the winner of the game is announced!

Each player will be randomly shown 16 cards with their faces down.
Select two of the cards by clicking on each with your mouse.
The cards will face up. If both cards are the same, (i.e you got a match) the cards will keep facing up.
Otherwise (i.e No match!), the cards will face back down after one second.
If the cards are different, the player must remember what is on the card so they can try
again and get all matches in the least amount of time.
The game is over when you have matched all of the pairs, and all the cards are faced upwards.

# How to Play:

Player one begins the game by clicking on the start Game button.
This will randomly shuffle images in the cards and begin the time.
After player one has completed their round and matched all giraffes, the timer will stop.
Player two can then begin their round by clicking on the same button that now reads "Player 2".
The same thing will happen.
After both players have completed their rounds, the winner of the game will be announced.
